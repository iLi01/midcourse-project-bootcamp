# Front End Development Midcourse Assignment

A week-long, group exercise for the bootcamp.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to create a static web application using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The assignment will focus on utilizing 3rd party APIs, making multiple API calls to different endpoints, allowing students to choose their own subject, features, and design for their web app.

Each team will be responsible for producing one web app, ensuring the validity of HTML5 structure, responsiveness of CSS, and clean and error-free JavaScript code.
